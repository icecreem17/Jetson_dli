# Jetson_dli_SUJIN PARK

## Learn the basics of Jetson Nano
```
Supplies
1. Jetson Nano
2. monitor(Recommend having a monitor in addition to your computer. If you use it on your computer (especially a laptop), there is a possibility of an OS collision.)
3. LAN USB
4. power(You have to use 5A with power. If you use more than that, Jetson Nano will be ruined.)
5. Wired mouse and keyboard(Wireless mice and keyboards are also available, but this repository does not show how to connect them.)
6. SD card(least to 32 GB)
7. USB Camera(It doesn't matter if I use another camera, but this repository only covers USB-Camera.)

P. S. MY laptop OS is Window. If your computer's OS is not Windows, steps 2-3 are different. So please find a method that suits your computer.
      And since the steps in this file are difficult to do in one day, we recommend doing them 3-4 hours a day for 2-3 days.

## 7. Installing languages that Jackson Nano does not include


### If your native language is English or you are fluent in it, skip thins process. but if you don't, install your native language.
### This course is the process of installing your native language (except English) and took Hangul as an example.
